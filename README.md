# codex-deploy

This codex deployment Repo offers an example deployment repository using Docker-compose and official codex images to setup an example environment.

It is divided into two parts:

A "ZARS" (Zentrale Antrags- und Registerstelle - Central Application and Registration Center) part, which creates a deployment of the centralized components neccessary for the deployment of the dezentralized feasibility query tool.

A "Num-Node" part, which provides a deployment for the decenctralized components
