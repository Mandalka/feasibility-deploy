[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/feasibility-deploy/releases)

This feasibility deployment repository offers an example deployment repository using docker-compose and official images to setup a feasibility portal (central) as well as feasibility triangle (decentral - at site)

It is divided into two parts:

A feasibility portal part, which creates a deployment of the centralized components neccessary for the deployment of the dezentralized feasibility query tool.

A feasibility triangle part, which provides a deployment for the decenctralized components.
